<p>미국 보수 세력의 싱크탱크 중 한명인 Frank Luntz가 만든<br/>&lsquo;공화당이 써서는 안되는 14가지 단어&rsquo; 목록.</p>
<p>각 쟁점에 대해 현재 사용 중이지만 절대 공화당의 입에서 나와서는 안되는 단어와 그 이유, 그리고 대체할 단어를 만들었다. 오늘 'Frame'에 관한 강연을 듣고 찾아봄. 오늘 강연에선 7번 단어, 'Undocumented Worker - Illegal Alien'을 예로 들었음. Undocumented Worker라는 말은 불법체류자를 이미 '노동자'의 범주에 포함시키기 때문에 이에 대해 강경한 주장을 펼 수 없으므로 이를 Illegal Alien으로 지칭해야한다고 주장.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix IX: THE 14 WORDS NEVER TO USE</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it is not what you say that matters but what you don’t say. Other times a single word or phrase can undermine or destroy the credibility of a paragraph or entire presentation. This memo was originally prepared exclusively for Congressional spouses because they are your eyes and ears, a one-person reality check and truth squad combined. However, by popular demand, I have included and expanded that document because effectively communicating requires you to STOP saying words and phrases that undermine your ability to educate the American people.</p>
<p>So from today forward, YOU are the language police. From today forward, these are the words never to say again.</p>
<p><strong>1. Government - Washington</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Government<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Washington</p>
<p>The fact is, most Americans appreciate their local government that picks up their trash, cleans their streets, and provides police and transportation services. Washington is the problem. Remind voters again and again about Washington spending, Washington waste, Washington taxation, Washington bureaucracy, Washington rules and Washington regulations. Then remind voters that if Washington created this mess, it is Washington’s responsibility to fix it. &ldquo;If we expect to succeed we must look to ourselves and not to Washington to raise our kids,start our businesses and improve our day-to-day lives.&rdquo; If you must talk about government, use the context defined by President Bush: &ldquo;Government should help people improve their lives not try to run their lives.</p>
<p><strong>2. Privatization/Private Accounts - Personalization/Personal Accounts</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Privatization/Private Accounts<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Personalization/Personal Accounts</p>
<p>Many more Americans would &quot;personalize&rdquo; Social Security than &ldquo;privatize&rdquo; it. In fact, two-thirds of America want to personalize Social Security while only one-third would privatize it. Why? Personalizing Social Security suggests ownership and control over your retirement savings, while privatizing it suggests a profit motive and winners and losers, BANISH PRIVATIZATION FROM YOUR LEXICON.</p>
<p><strong>3. Tax Reform - Tax Simplification</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Tax Reform<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Tax Simplification</p>
<p>While a majority of Americans are generally in favor of taxreform, one-third of the population fears that they would end up paying more intaxes if the tax code was in fact reformed. However, almost all Americansbelieve they would personally benefit from a tax code that was simplified &ndash; interms of money they owe, time they spend and anxiety about the IRS. When moreAmericans fear the IRS than root-canal surgery, something should be done tosimplify the tax code. </p>
<p><strong>4. Inheritance/Estate Tax - The Death Tax </strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Inheritance/Estate Tax<br/>INSTEAD SAY: The Death Tax</p>
<p>While a sizeable 68% of America thinks theInheritance/Estate Tax is unfair, fully 78% think that the Death Tax is unfair.And while a narrow majority would repeal the inheritance/estate tax, anoverwhelming majority would repeal the death tax. If you want to kill theestate tax, call it a death tax.</p>
<p><strong>5. A Global Economy/Globalization/Capitalism - Free Market Economy</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Global Economy/Globalization/Capitalism<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Free Market Economy</p>
<p>More Americans are afraid of the principle of globalizationthan even privatization. The reason? Globalization represents something big,something distant and something foreiwi. it.s the same reason why Americanslike their local government but dislike Washington &ndash; the closer you are, themore control you have. So instead of talking about the principles ofglobalization, instead emphasize &ldquo;the value and benefits of a free marketeconomy.&rdquo; Similarly, capitalism reminds people of harsh economic competitionthat yields losers as well as winners. Conversely, the free market economyprovides opportunity to all and allows everyone to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>6. Outsourcing - Taxation, Regulation, Litigation,Innovation, Education </strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Outsourcing<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Taxation, Regulation, Litigation, Innovation, Education</p>
<p>When you use the words of your oppositions you are basicallyaccepting their definition and therefore their conclusion. We should NEVER usethe word outsourcing because we will then be asked to defend or end thepractice of allowing companies to ship American jobs overseas. Rather, weshould talk about the &ldquo;root cause&rdquo; why any company would not want tohire &ldquo;the best workers in the world.&rdquo; And the answer:&ldquo;over-taxation, over-regulation, too much litigation, and not enoughinnovation or quality education.&rdquo; Because it rhymes, it will beremembered. </p>
<p><strong>7. Undocumented Workers - Illegal Aliens</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Undocumented Workers<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Illegal Aliens</p>
<p>The Dems have adopted the phrase &ldquo;undocumented worker&quot;but you shouldn’t. Call them exactly what they are. In fact, instead ofaddressing &quot;immigration reform, &quot;which polarizes Americans, youshould be talking about &quot;border security&rdquo; issues. Securing ourborders and our people has universal support.</p>
<p><strong>8. Foreign Trade - International Trade</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Foreign Trade<br/>INSTEAD SAY: International Trade</p>
<p>For many reasons unrelated to this issue, the word&quot;foreign&quot; conjures up negative images. Americans simply don’t like&quot;foreign oil,&ldquo; or &quot;foreign products&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreignnationals.&rdquo; International is a more positive concept than either foreignor global.</p>
<p><strong>9. Drilling for oil - Exploring for energy</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Drilling for oil<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Exploring for energy</p>
<p>It’s the picture people paint in their minds, the differencebetween an old-fashioned oilrig that gushes up black goop vs. 21st Centurytechnology and innovation that provides us the ability to heat our homes anddrive our cars. When you talk about energy, use words like&quot;responsible&quot; and &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; and always address yourconcern for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>10. Tort Reform - Lawsuit Abuse Reform</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Tort Reform<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Lawsuit Abuse Reform</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;tort&rdquo; has very little meaning to theaverage American, and at best reminds one of a French pastry. &ldquo;Lawsuit Abuse&quot;is something most Americans understand and resent. If you really want to makeyour case, add the word &quot;frivolous.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>11. Trial Lawyer - Personal Injury Lawyer </strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Trial Lawyer<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Personal Injury Lawyer</p>
<p>It is hard to distrust a trial lawyer because we see themportrayed so favorably on L.A. Law and Law &amp; Order. But personal injurylawyers, also known as ambulance chasers, remind people of those annoying,harassing commercials we see at 1:00 am cajoling us to sue someone. If you wantto get the frill bang for the buck, call them &ldquo;predatory personal injurylawyers.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>12. Corporate Transparency - Corporate Accountability </strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Corporate Transparency<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Corporate Accountability</p>
<p>I constantly hear the need for &quot;transparency&quot;coming from members of the financial services industry as well as Members ofCongress. But if you asked the American people, corporate accountability is amuch higher priority. The fact is, a majority of Americans can’t even explainwhat transparency actually means. But everyone understands and demandsaccountability from all sectors of the economy &hellip; and the government. </p>
<p><strong>13. School Choice - Parental Choice/Equal Opportunity in Education</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: School Choice<br/>INSTEAD SAY: Parental Choice/Equal Opportunity in Education</p>
<p>Americans are still evenly split over whether they support&quot;school choice&rdquo; in America’s schools. But they are heavily in favorof &ldquo;giving parents the right to choose th schools that are right for theirchildren,&rdquo; and there is almost universal support for &ldquo;equalopportunity in education.&rdquo; So frame the issue right and you get thesupport you need.</p>
<p><strong>14. Healthcare &ldquo;Choice” - &quot;The Right to Choose&rdquo;</strong><br/>NEVER SAY: Healthcare &ldquo;Choice”<br/>INSTEAD SAY: &quot;The Right to Choose&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an important nuance so often lost on politicalofficials. Almost all Americans want &ldquo;the right to choose the healthcareplan, hospital, doctor and prescription drug plan that is best for them,&quot;but far fewer Americans actually want to make that choice, In fact the olderyou get, the less eager you are to have a wide range of choices, One reason whythe prescription drug card earned only qualified public support was that itoffered too many choices and therefore created too much confusion for too manysenior citizens.</p>
<p>The entire playbook is here:</p>
