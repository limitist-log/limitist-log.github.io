<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation" title="Heuristic evaluation">Heuristic evaluation</a><span> (holistic)</span></strong><br/>A <strong>heuristic evaluation</strong> is a discount <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_inspection" title="Usability inspection">usability inspection</a> method for computer software that helps to identify <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability" title="Usability">usability</a> problems in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Interface_Design" title="User Interface Design">user interface (UI) design</a>. It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the &ldquo;heuristics&rdquo;). These evaluation methods are now widely taught and practiced in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Media" title="New Media">New Media</a> sector, where UIs are often designed in a short space of time on a budget that may restrict the amount of money available to provide for other types of interface testing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_walkthrough" title="Cognitive walkthrough">Cognitive walkthrough</a><span> (task-specific)</span></strong><br/>The <strong>cognitive walkthrough</strong> method is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_inspection_method" title="Usability inspection method">usability inspection method</a> used to identify <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability" title="Usability">usability</a> issues in a piece of software or web site, focusing on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system. Whereas <strong>cognitive walkthrough</strong> is task-specific, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation" title="Heuristic evaluation">heuristic evaluation</a> takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_inspection_method" title="Usability inspection method">usability inspection methods</a>. The method is rooted in the notion that users typically prefer to learn a system by using it to accomplish tasks, rather than, for example, studying a manual. The method is prized for its ability to generate results quickly with low cost, especially when compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing" title="Usability testing">usability testing</a>, as well as the ability to apply the method early in the design phases, before coding has even begun.</p>
