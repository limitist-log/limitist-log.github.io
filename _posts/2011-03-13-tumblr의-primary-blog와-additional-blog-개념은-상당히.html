<p>Primary Blog는 Tumblr 계정을 처음 만들 때 만들어지는 블로그이다. Additional Blog는 그 이후 추가하는 블로그다.</p>
<p>기본적인 시스템은 똑같은데, Primary Blog는 Social Feature들 (<span>Follow, Like, Reply, Ask, and Submit)을 다 사용할 수 있는 대신, 멀티유저(그룹식으로)나 패스워드 보호를 사용할 수 없다. Additional Blog는 그 반대.</span></p>
<p><span>제일 중요한 점은, 추후 Primary Blog와 Additional Blog를 바꿀 수 없다는 것. 그리고 난 그걸 너무 늦게 알아버려서.. (아무도 알려주지 않았다) Additional로 만들어야할 성격의 블로그를 Primary로 만들어버리는 바람에 그냥 계정을 새로 만들었다. 아래는 Tumblr로 부터 받은 답메일.</span></p>

<p>This information can help you understand the differences between the primary blog on your Tumblr account and any additional blogs on Tumblr account. It can also help you decide what type of blog to use for a given purpose and help you manage the blogs on your account.</p>
<p>*Primary Blog Assignment*</p>
<p>The primary blog that is made when you create your Tumblr account will always be the primary blog for the account. It is not possible to reassign which blog on your account is the primary blog. And, due the way in which Tumblr is architected, it is unlikely that we will be able to support reassignment of the primary blog in the foreseeable future. It is also unlikely that we will be able to support password protection on primary blogs.</p>
<p>*Differences Between Blog Types*</p>
<p>Each Tumblr account comes with a primary blog. A primary blog can fully use all of Tumblr&rsquo;s social features including Follow, Like, Reply, Ask, and Submit. But, a primary blog cannot be password-protected and cannot be multi-user.</p>
<p>You can also create additional blogs on your Tumblr account. An additional blog can be password protected for privacy and security and can be multi-user. But, an additional blog cannot fully use all of the Tumblr&rsquo;s social features. In many cases, an additional blog cannot be the initiator of a social feature but it can be the receiver of that social feature.</p>
<p>For example, an additional blog can be Followed, be Liked, be Asked, and be Submitted to. Those are all examples of being the receiver of social features. But, an additional blog cannot Follow another blog, Like a post, Reply to a post, Ask a question, or Submit a post. Those are examples of being the initiator of a social feature and those actions can only be performed by a primary blog.</p>
<p>Both types of blogs are capable of using the Reblog feature.</p>
<p>Tag searches and general content searches are not fully supported on password-protected additional blogs at this time. They are supported on primary blogs and on additional blogs that are not password-protected.</p>
